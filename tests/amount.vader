Before (Simple split):
  vsplit | windo split
  1wincmd w
  let width = winwidth(0)
  let height = winheight(0)

After (Close all extra windows):
  for @_ in range(3)
    close
  endfor
  AssertEqual 1, winnr('$')

Do (Resize by 3 to the left):
  3\<C-W>\<C-H>

Then (Assert that width decreased by 3):
  AssertEqual height, winheight(0)
  AssertEqual -3, winwidth(0) - width

Do (Resize by 4 to the bottom):
  4\<C-W>\<C-J>

Then (Assert that height increased by 4):
  AssertEqual width, winwidth(0)
  AssertEqual 4, winheight(0) - height

Do (Resize by 5 to the top):
  5\<C-W>\<C-K>

Then (Assert that width decreased by 5):
  AssertEqual width, winwidth(0)
  AssertEqual -5, winheight(0) - height

Do (Resize by 6 to the right):
  6\<C-W>\<C-L>

Then (Assert that width increased by 6):
  AssertEqual height, winheight(0)
  AssertEqual 6, winwidth(0) - width
