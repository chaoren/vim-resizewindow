Before (Make 3 vertical splits and go to left most):
  vsplit | vsplit
  AssertEqual 3, winnr('$')
  1wincmd w
  let width = winwidth(0)
  let height = winheight(0)

After (Close all extra windows):
  for @_ in range(2)
    close
  endfor
  AssertEqual 1, winnr('$')

Do (Resize left most window left):
  \<C-W>\<C-H>

Then (Assert that width decreased):
  AssertEqual height, winheight(0)
  Assert winwidth(0) < width

Do (Resize left most window down):
  \<C-W>\<C-J>

Then (Assert that height didn't change):
  AssertEqual width, winwidth(0)
  AssertEqual height, winheight(0)

Do (Resize left most window up):
  \<C-W>\<C-K>

Then (Assert that height didn't change):
  AssertEqual width, winwidth(0)
  AssertEqual height, winheight(0)

Do (Resize left most window right):
  \<C-W>\<C-L>

Then (Assert that width increased):
  AssertEqual height, winheight(0)
  Assert winwidth(0) > width
